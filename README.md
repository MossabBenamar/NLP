# NLP-Based Code Debugger and Solution Recommender

## Overview

This project implements an NLP-based system that analyzes code errors, understands the context, and provides recommendations for fixing the issues. The system takes code (in various programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.) as input and analyzes error messages or logs generated during code execution.

## Features

- **Code Input**: Submit code or a portion of code where an error has occurred.
- **Error Analysis**: Process the error log, identify keywords, and analyze the code surrounding the error.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Use context-based NLP techniques to understand what the programmer intended and compare it with known patterns of similar errors and solutions.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Suggest potential fixes, such as:
  - Fixing common bugs like syntax errors, undefined variables, or type mismatches.
  - Refactoring the code to improve readability or efficiency.
  - Improving error handling or edge case coverage.
- **Explanation**: Provide an explanation of why a certain error occurred and why the suggested solution works.
- **Solution Examples**: Provide examples in the form of code snippets or general debugging advice.

## Technologies Used

- **NLP Techniques**: Text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and sequence-to-sequence models for generating fixes.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained models such as GPT-3, Codex, or CodeBERT for understanding and generating code solutions.
- **Error Log Analysis**: Custom rules and machine learning for analyzing specific programming language error logs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-code-debugger.git
   cd nlp-code-debugger
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Enter your code and error message in the provided fields, then click "Analyze".

4. Review the analysis results and solution recommendations.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Main page of the application.
- `POST /api/analyze`: Analyze code and generate solutions.
  - Request body: `{"code": "...", "error_message": "...", "language": "python"}`
  - Response: Analysis results and solution recommendations.
- `GET /api/examples/<example_id>`: Get example code and error messages.

## Running Tests

Run the tests using the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Future Improvements

- Support for more programming languages.
- Integration with code editors and IDEs.
- Improved accuracy through more training data.
- Real-time error detection and suggestion.
- User feedback mechanism to improve recommendations.
